🌿** Plant Disease Detection CNN Model**

A** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for detecting plant diseases from leaf images. 
The model is trained on a large dataset of ~72,000 images, but uses ~20,000 images for efficient training and testing.

**Overview**

This project provides a CNN model capable of classifying 38 classes of plant diseases across multiple crops, including Apple, Tomato, Grape, Potato, Peach, and more. 
The trained model can be used for real-time disease detection from leaf images.
